> **Building gateways, not gatekeepers** - A community-driven wellness tool directory

![Open Source](https://img.shields.io/badge/Open%20Source-❤️-green) ![Mental Health](https://img.shields.io/badge/Mental%20Health-For%20Everyone-blue) ![Community](https://img.shields.io/badge/Community-Driven-purple)

A community-powered platform for sharing and discovering emotional wellness tools from across the internet. Whether it's a Claude app, calculator, worksheet, or any other digital tool - if it helps people, we want it here.

**Our Philosophy:** We believe mental health resources should be accessible to everyone. Instead of being gatekeepers who control access, we're building gateways that connect people with the tools they need.

## ⚠️ Security Notice

**This is a development version.** Before deploying to production:

1. **Configure proper environment variables** (never commit `.env.local`)
2. **Enable Row Level Security in Supabase** (currently disabled for testing)
3. **Change default admin password** from development settings
4. **Review all security policies** before public deployment

For production deployment, see the security checklist in [`todos.md`](todos.md).

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd jongu-tool-garden
npm install
```

### 2. Set Up Supabase

1. **Create a Supabase Project**
   - Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
   - Create a new project
   - Note your project URL and API keys

2. **Set Up Database Schema**
   - Go to your Supabase dashboard → SQL Editor
   - Run the following SQL:

```sql
-- Tools table
CREATE TABLE tools (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  claude_url TEXT NOT NULL,
  category TEXT NOT NULL CHECK (category IN ('mindfulness', 'distress-tolerance', 'emotion-regulation', 'interpersonal-effectiveness')),
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  creator_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  creator_link TEXT,
  creator_background TEXT,
  thumbnail_url TEXT,
  avg_rating DECIMAL(2,1) DEFAULT 0,
  total_ratings INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  view_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  click_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  approved BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Ratings table
CREATE TABLE ratings (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  tool_id UUID REFERENCES tools(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_ip TEXT NOT NULL,
  rating INTEGER CHECK (rating >= 1 AND rating <= 5),
  review_text TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(tool_id, user_ip)
);

-- Submissions table (moderation queue)
CREATE TABLE submissions (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  title TEXT NOT NULL,
  claude_url TEXT NOT NULL,
  category TEXT NOT NULL,
  description TEXT NOT NULL,
  creator_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  creator_link TEXT,
  creator_background TEXT,
  thumbnail_url TEXT,
  submitter_ip TEXT,
  reviewed BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  approved BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX idx_tools_category ON tools(category);
CREATE INDEX idx_tools_approved ON tools(approved);
CREATE INDEX idx_tools_rating ON tools(avg_rating DESC);
CREATE INDEX idx_tools_created ON tools(created_at DESC);

-- Row Level Security (RLS) Policies
ALTER TABLE tools ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE ratings ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE submissions ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Tools: Public read access for approved tools
CREATE POLICY "Public read approved tools" ON tools
  FOR SELECT USING (approved = true);

-- Ratings: Public read access
CREATE POLICY "Public read ratings" ON ratings
  FOR SELECT USING (true);

-- Ratings: Insert with rate limiting (handled in API)
CREATE POLICY "Public insert ratings" ON ratings
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true);

-- Submissions: Public insert only
CREATE POLICY "Public insert submissions" ON submissions
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (true);

-- Function to update tool rating after new rating
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_tool_rating()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  UPDATE tools SET
    avg_rating = (
      SELECT ROUND(AVG(rating)::numeric, 1)
      FROM ratings WHERE tool_id = NEW.tool_id
    ),
    total_ratings = (
      SELECT COUNT(*)
      FROM ratings WHERE tool_id = NEW.tool_id
    )
  WHERE id = NEW.tool_id;
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Trigger to automatically update ratings
CREATE TRIGGER update_tool_rating_trigger
  AFTER INSERT ON ratings
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION update_tool_rating();
```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**
   - Copy `env.example` to `.env.local`
   - Fill in your Supabase credentials:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_simple_admin_password
```

### 3. Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the app.

## Deployment

### Deploy to Vercel

1. **Push to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Connect to Vercel**
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Import your GitHub repository
   - Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard
   - Deploy automatically

3. **Environment Variables in Vercel**
   - Go to your project settings → Environment Variables
   - Add all variables from `.env.local`

### Deploy to Supabase

Your Supabase backend is already deployed! Just make sure to:

1. **Enable Row Level Security** (done in SQL above)
2. **Configure API Keys** (done in environment variables)
3. **Set up Edge Functions** (optional for email notifications)

## 🎯 Mission & Vision

**Mission**: To democratize access to mental health and wellness tools by creating an open, community-driven platform that connects people with resources that actually help.

**Vision**: A world where mental health support is accessible, diverse, and community-powered - where we build gateways instead of gatekeeping access to wellness.

## 🏆 Inspiration

This project is inspired by the Ghost foundation model - an NGO that believes in open source, community ownership, and putting mission before profit. Just like Ghost revolutionized publishing, we want to revolutionize how people discover and share mental health tools.
