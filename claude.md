To dos:
1) Thumbnaisl imagur images are not showing, fix that
2) Take away number of people helped, since there is no authentication and no way of verifying
3) Sort by rating is being smaller to largest, it should be the other way around
4) I want it to be any tool in the internet, not just claude app. So allow for any links to be pasted and change the language apropriately from the field: Claude Artifact URL
5) Vercel is not working with current environment variables, help me debug
