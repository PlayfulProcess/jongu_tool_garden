To dos:
a) Create a new brand for development
b) Look into the UI of categories and submissions... A couple of things I found:
1) No error message of why form hasn't been submitted when a couple of fields or one were left blank
2) Mindfulness is not showing with creativity when user makes a selection.... Can we change that without SUpabase changes? if so, let's change it
