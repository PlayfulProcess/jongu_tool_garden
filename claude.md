To dos:
1) Commit changes
2) Thumbnails are still not showing in home page
3) Advise me on how to open source this. If it is safe to make it public on Github I will want to:
a) make it public
b) make it clear that is open source
c) document it well, as well as how to collaborate
d) market it as open source because we believe in the cause and we are inspired by Ghost model of an NGO +Open Source. link this: https://www.playfulprocess.com/following-what-feels-right-is-a-process-indie-hacking/
